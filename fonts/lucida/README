These fonts were extracted from the tape sent from Charles Bigelow, of Bigelow
and Holmes.  There are 112 files which have been extracted using the "extract"
script, and renamed using the "rename" script which I wrote.  Nothing else has
been done to these fonts, and it is presumed that they have been extracted
from the tape okay, though they may not.  The file "header" was extracted first
with the command "dd if=/dev/nrmt0 of=header files=1".
