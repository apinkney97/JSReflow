This program makes a Postscript font out from a BDF font.  It will not
work with large, two byte BDF fonts such as Chinese or Japanese BDF
fonts.  It also ignores any entries that have an ENCODING value less
than zero.

You might want to tune some of the Postscript parameters by hand to
get the output closer to what you want.  There is a short description
of this in the man page.

This program depends heavily on the SWIDTH entry for each character.
Please see the "Bitmaps Distribution Format 2.1" document for details
on SWIDTH.  You can also send me email for a copy of this document.

Please send bug reports, enhancements, etc. to:
