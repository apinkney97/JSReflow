This program converts raw bitmap fonts into BDF format fonts.  It
allows for things like skipping headers on the input font and doing
bit and byte adjustments dependent on architecture.

I wrote bintobdf because I was tired of hacking out a new utility
every time I wanted to convert a raw bitmap font into a BDF font.

Bintobdf is designed primarily for fiddling with fonts that have a
large number of characters (i.e. some of the Oriental fonts), but it
can easily be used for just about any size raw bitmap font.  The only
real "gotcha" in the program is the assumption that the font's
characters are square.  This is hardcoded, so it would have to be
changed for other types of fonts.
