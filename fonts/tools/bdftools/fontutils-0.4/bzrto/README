This program converts outline fonts in the homegrown BZR format to a
form usable for typesetting, such as Metafont or PostScript.

The Metafont file `bzrsetup.mf' is input by the MF code output by this
program, so mf must be able to find it.  You can generate a font at a
given size with a command line such as (`$ ' being the shell prompt):
$ mf '\mode:=localfont; designsize:=24pt#; input foofont'
To make a 24pt version of foofont.  The default size is 10pt.

The BZR format is described in `../bzr/README'.
