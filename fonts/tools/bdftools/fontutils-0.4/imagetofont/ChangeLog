          just that the horizontal one is.

        * bb-outline.c (is_outline_edge): Changed VALID_LOCATION to
          BITMAP_VALID_PIXEL.

          void, so will fit into our code.
          Make it return false instead of an error message.

        * pbm.h (top): pbmplus.h is in the current directory, so take out
          the `../' before it in the #include.
          (pbmreadpbmrow): Make it return a boolean instead of a void, so
          will fit into our code.

        * input-img.c (top): Now #include img-header.h.
          (get_img_header): Got rid of variable format, as now put that in
          the header.

          get_scanline): Declared these pointers to functions so could set
          them to a set of routines belonging to the type of input we're
          using.  Set them to .pbm input format routines as a default.
          (font_name_extension): Added this static variable so could set
          it when get read the input format on the command line.  Set to
          `.pbm' by default.
          (main): Initialize img_header to all zeros so will know if the
          user set them using the command line.
          Changed call to open_img_input_file to open_input_file and
          concat font_name_extension instead of ".img" for the argument.
          Changed some comments.
          Changed the call to get_img_header to get_header.
          Changed the call to close_img_input_file to close_input_file.

          horizontal and vertical resolutions on the command line.
          Added horz-resolution, img-input-format, pbm-input-format, and
          vert-resolution to the option variable long_options.
          If the argument is horz-resolution or vert-resolution, then set
          the appropriate field in the header.
          If the argument if img-input-format or pbm-input-format, the set
          the input function pointers in main to the appropriate set of
          functions that belong to the input format.  If the argument is
          the former, then set needs_resolution to false; if it's the latter,
          set it to true. 
          If the user wants .pbm input format, then check that the header's 
          resolutions are set; if not, issue an error message and exit. 
          
        * main.h (open_input_file, close_input_file, get_header, get_scanline):
          Added these function pointer declarations so extract.c and strips.c
