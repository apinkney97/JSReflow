This program adds sidebearings to a bitmap font, and outputs a revised
bitmap font and a TFM file.  It reads several auxiliary ``side bearing
information'' (SBI) files to determine the side bearings.  Comments in
the sources describe the file format (somewhat).

The ideas behind the SBI files are based on Harry Smith's (Linotype)
principles, as explicated by Walter Tracy in his book _Letters of
Credit_.
