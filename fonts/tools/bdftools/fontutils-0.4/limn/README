This program converts bitmap fonts to a homegrown outline format, bezier
(BZR).  The program `bzrto' converts that format to something usable for
typesetting.

We used two main sources in writing the program:

(1) Phoenix: an interactive curve design system based on the automatic
fitting of hand-sketched curves, by Philip J. Schneider, Master's
thesis, University of Washington, 1988.

(2) Curve-fitting with piecewise parametric cubics, by Michael Plass and
Maureen Stone, Computer Graphics, SIGGRAPH proceedings, volume 17,
number 3, July 1983.

We had access to the code for Phoenix, thanks to Philip, but none of our
code is based on his (mostly because his task was allow interactive
sketching, and ours to fit bitmap characters, and the two require
different data structures).  The general outline of the fitting
algorithm does come from Phoenix.
