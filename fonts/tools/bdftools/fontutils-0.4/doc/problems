On many machines (Sun 3/4 running SunOS 4.1, Sun386i running 4.0.2, 386
  running ISC 2.2), gcc 1.40 gets a fatal error compiling
  imagetofont/main.c with -O.  Just use -g for that file.


Under SunOS 4.x, the programs which use X (xbfe and limn) cannot be
  statically linked.  I get 
  mbstowcs.o: Undefined symbol _dlsym referenced from text segment
  wcstombs.o: Undefined symbol _dlsym referenced from text segment
  mblib.o: Undefined symbol _dlclose referenced from text segment
  mblib.o: Undefined symbol _dlopen referenced from text segment

  I don't understand why (1) these multibyte functions are being pulled
  in (via __Xsi...) at all; I'm not using any multibyte features; and
  (2) why the multibyte functions need to specifically call the dynamic
  linking functions.  I would be grateful for explanations and/or suggestions.
  
  The only permutation that I have seen work is to use libXaw.a, so that
  the form, label, and viewport widgets aren't defined twice (if anyone
  can explain why the entire .sa file needs to be pulled in, I'd like to
  hear it), and doing a dynamic link (i.e., with /bin/ld).


On a 386 running Interactive UNIX 2.2, you should be aware that <math.h>
  has the wrong prototype for fmod(3): the routine takes two doubles, not
  one.  I corrected my system include file.


Also on a 386 running ISC 2.2, shared libraries cause still more
  problems.  I have run a number of tests, listed below.  The bottom
  line is that I changed gcc's tm file to define the following.  I use
  Michael Bloom's stabs-in-coff stuff (i.e., gas but no robotussin), but
  I don't think that matters here.
  
/* Don't use -lc_s, since then 1) gdb tries to step into library routines;
   and 2) programs like textutils' csplit, which use POSIX signals,
   cannot link, because signal, sighold, etc. are multiply defined.
   (But we still need -shlib to specify crtp1 instead of crtp0.)  */
#define LIB_SPEC "%{posix:-lcposix} -lc"

Here are the results of linking with various startup files and libraries
in various orders:
  crtp0 -lc_s -lcposix		=> sysisc undefined
  crtp0 -lc_s -lcposix -lc	=> xbfe -display otherhost:0 gets
                                     default_new_handler: out of memory
  crtp1 -lc_s -lcposix -lc	=> xbfe works, but csplit (in textutils)
                                     gets signal, sighold, ... multiply defined
  crtp0 -lcposix -lc_s		=> _cleanup, fclose, ... multiply defined
  crtp1 -lcposix -lc_s		=> 		"
  crtp0 -lcposix -lc_s -lc	=> 		"
  crtp1 -lcposix -lc_s -lc	=>		"
  crtp0 -lcposix -lc		=> links, but xbfe -display otherhost:0 
                                     crashes in CallTliServer (in nsl_s)
  crtp1 -lcposix -lc		=> xbfe works, csplit links

  Conclusion: -lc_s and POSIX signals conflict.  Don't use -lc_s, ever.
