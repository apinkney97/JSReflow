If you encounter any problems, please send the following to
bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu.  Thanks.

* the fontutils version (from `ChangeLog' or `Makefile.in').
* your hardware and operating system.
* a description of the bug.

If the bug was in using some program (as opposed to installation),
also include:
* any command-line arguments.
* the relevant input files.  Since fonts and images are typically binary
  files, be sure to uuencode or btoa them first.

If you wish to suggest changes in the sources, or even to discuss
something in the sources, do it by context, not line number.
