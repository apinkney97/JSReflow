To compile these programs, you must have the following installed:

* GCC, version 1.40 or greater.
* GNU make; probably any version > 3.50 or so will do.

To compile and use the programs which use X, you also need:
* X11R5 or R5 unshared libraries and headers.
* An X11 server.

To use gsrenderfont, you will need Ghostscript, version 2.4 or greater.

To make any use of the fonts, you will probably need TeX, Metafont and
their friends, especially pltotf and gftopk.

See `doc/archives' for information on how to get all these things.
