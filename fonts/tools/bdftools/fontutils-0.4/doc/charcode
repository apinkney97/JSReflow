Many of the programs allow you to specify character codes in the fonts
for various purposes.  All such programs parse character codes in the
same way.  The following variations are permitted: a single character,
as in `K' or `0'; an octal number, as in `0113'; a hex number, as in
`0x4a' or `0x4B' or `0X4B', etc; a decimal number, as in `75'.
