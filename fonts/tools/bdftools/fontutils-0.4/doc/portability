We didn't worry about portability in the usual Unix sense.  Here is an
excerpt from the GNU coding standards:

        Much of what is called "portability" in the Unix world refers to
	porting to different Unix versions.  This is not relevant to GNU
	software, because its purpose is to run on top of one and only
	one kernel, the GNU kernel, compiled with one and only one C
	compiler, the GNU C compiler.  

Well, the GNU kernel does not yet exist, but the GNU C compiler does.  The
software here will not compile with other C compilers---even ANSI ones.
I use features of GNU C in places where they were useful.  I wrote the
makefiles for GNU make, and used many of its special features.
