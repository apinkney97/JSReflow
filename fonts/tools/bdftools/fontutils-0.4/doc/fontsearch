These programs are based on the TeX project font formats: TFM for font
metrics, GF and PK for the bitmaps.  You may therefore find TeX and its
companion programs useful.  You can get TeX by ftp from (among many
other places) ics.uci.edu; write elisabet@max.acs.washington.edu for
ordering information on a tape.

These programs use the same environment variables and algorithms for
finding font files as TeX and its friends do (at least in the latest
release of Unix TeX, which I happen to also maintain).  You specify the
default paths in the top-level Makefile.  The environment variables
TEXFONTS, PKFONTS, TEXPKS, and GFFONTS override the paths there.

Specifically, a TFM file is looked for along the path specified by
TEXFONTS; a GF file along GFFONTS, then TEXFONTS; a PK file along
PKFONTS, then TEXPKS, then TEXFONTS.

In either the default value or the environment variable value, if a
component ends with two slashes, all subdirectories of the given
directory are searched.

A leading or trailing colon in an environment variable value is replaced
by the default.

You can specify a particular font at a particular resolution by saying,
for example (`$ ' being the shell prompt):
$ program foo.300
or
$ program -dpi=300 foo
(You can also say `program foo.300gf', but the `gf' is ignored.  These
programs always look for a given font in PK format before looking for it
in GF format, under the assumption that if both fonts exist, with the
same stem, they are the same.)
