The programs here can all be improved.  If you want to work on them,
send mail to me (karl@cs.umb.edu), so I can help avoid duplicated
effort.

bzrto:
* output more font formats, e.g., TrueType.
* output hints for Metafont and Type 1 fonts.
* handle accented characters somehow; should it be here, or in limn, or ...?

fontconvert:
* output in virtual font format.
* allow specifying input encodings and output encodings as files (the
  same .enc files that the other programs read).

gf:
* support multiple simultaneous open fonts, like pk does now.

gsrenderfont:
* allow for characters larger than 1" square.

imagetofont:
* understand more image formats, e.g., tiff.
* implement a good rotation algorithm.

imgrotate:
* combine with imagetofont.

lib:
* extend the encoding files to math attributes.  Probably rewrite as a
  bison grammar.  (I have it started.)
* write a variant of string_to_bitmap (in font.c) which understand kerns
  and ligatures.
* add support for BDF fonts.

limn:
* handle the standard X toolkit options.

pk:
* implement PK output.

tfm:
* support multiple simultaneous open fonts, like pk does now.
* support ligatures in their full generality.

xbfe:
* see xbfe/README.
