The programs here do not have counterparts on Unix systems.  Therefore,
I didn't have to conform to an existing interface; therefore, the
programs use `getopt_long_only' to parse the command lines.  As a
result, you can use `-', `--', or `+' to start an option; you can use
unambiguous abbreviations for option names; you can separate option
names and values with either `=' or ` '; you can use filenames that
would otherwise look like options by putting them after an option `--'.

All the programs have an option `-help' (or `+help', or `--help'), which
prints all the possible options.  I haven't written any ``real''
documentation.  To quote the X documentation, paraphrasing George Lucas,
``Use the source, Luke''.
