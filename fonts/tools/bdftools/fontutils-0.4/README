This is the GNU font manipulation utilities distribution.

Send suggestions and bug reports for this software to 
bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu or karl@cs.umb.edu.

See `INSTALL' for installation instructions.
See `doc/*' for some random documentation.
See `README' in each directory for program- or library-specific information.
See `COPYING*' for copying permissions; these programs are free software.
See `ChangeLog' or `Makefile.in' for the version number.

Here is a brief description of the various programs, in the order in
which you might want to use them:
* imagetofont reads an image in PBM or IMG format, and writes
  a bitmap font in GF format.
* charspace reads a bitmap font and tries to figure out reasonable side
  bearing values; it outputs a revised bitmap font and a font metric file.
* xbfe is a hand-editor for bitmap fonts which runs under X11.
* limn reads a bitmap font and fits splines to the bitmaps; outputs a
  BZR file. 
* bzrto reads a BZR file and outputs it in Metafont or PostScript.

We've also written the following:
* gsrenderfont uses Ghostscript to render a PostScript font at a
  particular point size and resolution into a PBM file, then uses
  imagetofont to make a bitmap font out of it.
* fontconvert reads one or more bitmap font(s) and can rearrange the
  characters, filter them, omit them, split them into pieces, combine
  them, etc., etc.  It can also output a TFM file.
* imgrotate rotates or flips an IMG file.

Some of this software was originally written as part of the research
project in digital typography at the University of Massachusetts at
Boston, directed by Robert A. Morris.  UMB has also been kind enough to
let us to continue to use their computers, despite our completing the
Master's program there.
