COMPILATION

snftobdf is pretty much self contained except for some header files it
needs from the X11 source.  The Imakefile should generate the correct
Makefile, but some sites seem to have their toplevel distribution
source define incorrect.  If you don't have access to the site.def
file for imake, simply uncomment the line containing TOPDIR in the
Imakefile and set it to the location of the X11 distribution on your
system.

NOTES

Due to some TeX font wierdnesses, some gf/pk/pxl files that are
converted to X11 format have characters of width 0, particularly the
music16.85.snf font, generated from the MuTeX .pk font.  snftobdf will
fill in the width value.


BUGS

I have only tested this code on Big Endian architectures, so I'm not
completely sure the bit and byte swapping works as it should.

Thanks to "der Mouse" for the SWIDTH calculation.

Thanks to Satoshi Asami and Taketo Tsukioka of University of Tokyo for
bug fix for Kanji fonts and fix for missing font names.

Please send fixes or bugs to: mleisher@nmsu.edu
