This program takes a "selection file" and a file of Hershey glyphs
and creates 3 output files:

	a .pro file -- PostScript code that when included in a PostScript
		program makes a font that may then be accessed via 'findfont'
	a .afm file -- provides the Adobe Font Metrics information needed
		by the TranScript shell file 'afmdit' to construct a
		troff .out file
	a .map file -- used by TranScript software to map the 2-character
		troff font name to the internal font name

To make the whole shebang, just say "make".

If you have Adobe's TranScript package, you dispose of the output
files as follows:

	.pro -- goes in /usr/add-on/ps/lib [Your Directories May Vary]

	.afm -- goes in /usr/add-on/ps/lib and /usr/lsrc/transcript/lib

	.map -- goes in /usr/lsrc/transcript/lib/ditroff.font

Then sort the `font.map+' lines into your font.map, merge the `moreout' line
into your /usr/lsrc/transcript/lib/ditroff.font/Makefile, and run make in
this directory.  Scatter the .out and .aux files to their proper places
[probably /usr/lib/font/devpsc].

Now if you have the version of TranScript I do, you are done.  (I've locally
modified mine to automatically merge the .pro file with the rest of the
psdit output whenever a "non-standard font" is used in a document.  I can't
send you these modifications but you might try expressing your wishes
to adobe!shore in hope of altering the future.)  Otherwise you need to
arrange some other method of merging the proper .pro files before printing
the output.

Usage:	(if you wish to build fonts other than the ones I did)
 	hersel font.sel hersh.oc

Notes:
	1.  I didn't bother with ligatures (none of the fonts I encoded
	had any).

	2.  I only encoded characters in Adobe's Standard Encoding.  You'll
	have to do some twiddling to get the Christmas tree into a font.

	3.  To keep the regular fonts dainty, I have used a rather narrow
	pen width.  This looks fine at small character sizes, but at
	larger sizes the characters show gaps in the strokes.  I'd just
	use the "bold" variety of the font when this happens but you might
	feel like adjusting the penwidth for the basic font.

	4.  I didn't like the spacing on most of the fonts so put a provision
	in the select file to adjust the left and right "boundaries" (not
	really side-bearings as the character origin isn't given and had
	to be divined) of a character.  These are the third and fourth fields
	on the character selection line when present.  You may feel like
	adjusting them again.  The Gothic fonts probably could use some
	tuning, too, but I haven't done them.
