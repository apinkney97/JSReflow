This program will take the Hershey Font files in the format recently
posted to USENET and converts them to a PostScript language stream
that will print sampler pages when shipped to a PostScript printer.

It won't generate anything suitable for consumption by troff, but it
gives you a starting point.

Usage:
	cat hersh.o?? ^ herps ^ lp -dPostScript

	(or "lpr something" on Berkeley UNIX) 

Notes:
	1.  The fonts look better than I expected, and certainly scale
	better than other bit-mapped fonts I've played with.  I'm particularly
	fond of the two Grade-School Script fonts and think a memo written
	using them might really impress a Vice President.

	2.  I set the baseline as if all characters were the large ("regular")
	size.  If you really want to use the smaller characters instead of
	scaling the larger ones to the right size, you'll have to tweak this.

	3.  I generated all characters with the same pen width, you might
	experiment with modifying that, too.

	4.  The program is lazy, takes no arguments, gives no usage message,
	and may be used only as a filter.  Sorry.
