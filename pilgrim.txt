The man therefore read it, and looking upon Evangelist very carefully, said, "Whither must I fly?" Then said Evangelist, (pointing with his finger over a very wide field,) "Do you see yonder wicket-gate?" Matt.
7:13,14. The man said, "No." Then said the other, "Do you see yonder
shining light?" Psalm 119:105; 2 Pet. 1:19. He said, "I think I do."
Then said Evangelist, "Keep that light in your eye, and go up directly
thereto, so shalt thou see the gate; at which, when thou knockest, it
shall be told thee what thou shalt do." So I saw in my dream that the
man began to run. Now he had not run far from his own door when his
wife and children, perceiving it, began to cry after him to return; but
the man put his fingers in his ears, and ran on crying, Life! life!
eternal life! Luke 14:26. So he looked not behind him, Gen. 19:17, but
fled towards the middle of the plain.
